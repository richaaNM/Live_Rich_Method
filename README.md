# Hey, I'm Rich 👋  
**Fitness Entrepreneur | Builder | Wellness Ecosystem Architect**

I’m a **fitness entrepreneur** building a tech platform that helps everyday people take ownership of their health and wellness journey — through insight, education, and real connection to the **right people, tools, and places**.

This isn’t another tracker or program. It’s the **Silk Road of Health, Wellness, and Fitness** — a digital ecosystem designed to empower users (not just elite athletes) to build the confidence, skills, and support system they need to become the hero in their own story.

I’m using tools like **GitHub, Lovable, Miro, Whimsical, Udemy**, and AI platforms like **ChatGPT and Claude** to prototype, document, and share this journey with a larger community of creators, movers, and everyday heroes.
